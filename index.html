                                year yet. Students launched solid, liquid, and hybrid rockets to target 
                                altitudes of 10,000 and 30,000 feet.

                    Auburn's mission is to create innovative, determined engineers with hands-on designing and manufacturing
                    experience, while also educating surrounding communities about
                    the importance of STEM through educational events. Challenging, engaging activities such as NASA's Student
                    Launch program help to develop the requisite skills and
                    invaluable experience needed to develop the next generation of engineers.
