                    Welcome to the Auburn University Rocketry Association. We are a student organization interested in aeronautics
                    and astronautics, rocketry,
                    and all things space-related! Our main purpose is to compete in various rocket launch competitions throughout
                    the year and across the country.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Some of the competitions we engage in are NASA's Student Launch Initiative and SpacePort America's Space Cup. We
                    design, build, and launch
                    rockets from the ground up and compete with other schools and organizations around the country.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Our team activities include recovery, testing, embedded systems design, payload, educational outreach, and
                    safety. Each of these activities
                    is assigned to a team, under the direction of a veteran team member.
                    <br />

                                        We would love to hear from you or swing by to meet the team leads! Here are the details:

                    Auburn's mission is to create innovative, determined engineers with hands-on designing and manufacturing
                    experience, while also educating surrounding communities about
                    the importance of STEM through educational events. Challenging, engaging activities such as NASA's Student
                    Launch program help to develop the requisite skills and
                    invaluable experience needed to develop the next generation of engineers.
