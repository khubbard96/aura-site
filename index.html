                    Welcome to the Auburn University Rocketry Association. We are a student organization interested in aeronautics
                    and astronautics, rocketry,
                    and all things space-related! Our main purpose is to compete in various rocket launch competitions throughout
                    the year and across the country, but we also help expose students at all levels to rocketry and spaceflight, as
                    well as helping our members with industry-level certifications.

                    AURA is an umbrella organization that includes several sub-groups, pertaining to our competitions and internal
                    activities. Have a look at some of the details of our sub-groups.

                    Auburn's mission is to create innovative, determined engineers with hands-on designing and manufacturing
                    experience, while also educating surrounding communities about
                    the importance of STEM through educational events. Challenging, engaging activities such as NASA's Student
                    Launch program help to develop the requisite skills and
                    invaluable experience needed to develop the next generation of engineers.
